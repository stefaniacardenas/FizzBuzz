# FizzBuzz Kata
================

This is the first kata I learnt at Makers Academy. It's a simple FizzBuzz developed in TDD.

Rules
-----
Any number divisible by three is replaced by the word 'Fizz' and any divisible by five by the word 'Buzz'. Numbers divisible by both become 'FizzBuzz'.
All the other numbers will be printed as they are.

Technologies used
