# FizzBuzz Kata
================

This is the first kata I learnt at [Makers Academy] (http://www.makersacademy.com/â€Ž). It's a simple FizzBuzz game developed in TDD.

You can watch a screencast of this kata on [Youtube] (http://youtu.be/f3n-Ub7BzUo)

Rules
-----
Any number divisible by three is replaced by the word 'Fizz' and any divisible by five by the word 'Buzz'. Numbers divisible by both become 'FizzBuzz'.
All the other numbers will be printed as they are.
